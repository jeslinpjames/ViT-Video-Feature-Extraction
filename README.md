# ViT-Video-Feature-Extraction

ViT Video Feature Extraction is a Python script for extracting keyframes from video files and then extracting features from those keyframes using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model.

## Features

- Keyframe extraction from video files.
- Feature extraction from keyframes using a Vision Transformer model.
- Organize and store extracted features in CSV files.

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- pandas
- pytorch_pretrained_vit (Vision Transformer model)

You can install the required libraries using pip:
